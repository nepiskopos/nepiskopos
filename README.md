## 💼 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and Software Developer with 8+ years of experience delivering end-to-end solutions across commercial and EU-funded R&D projects. I specialize in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI**, and **AI-driven systems** in domains like **Healthcare**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Banking**.

Currently at **IBM**, I design and deploy LLM-based chatbot solutions tailored to banking clients using tools like **Docker**, **Azure**, and **RAG architectures**.

I am deeply passionate about how **AI and Data Science** shape the future — both technologically and socially — and how they can be responsibly applied for meaningful impact.
